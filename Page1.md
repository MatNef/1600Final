# Installation

First thing is first; in order to create an audio file in **Audacity**, you need to have the software on your computer. 
Go to the [Audacity website](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) and choose the respective system your computer uses. 
My computer uses **Windows**, so I would choose **Windows** download.

You may have an ad blocker or firewall that prevents the download; either disable them or allow access for the download.

When the download begins, it will indicate that it is an .exe file and asks if you wish to keep it; select "Keep".
Once it has finished the download, you may begin the installation. Follow the prompts of "Install" and "Next". 
You may choose the destination location; change it if you want, I recommend the default. 
Create a desktop shortcut if you want; the program can be easily reached by typing **Audacity** in your search bar. 
The installation will be complete once you click "Finish". A box is checked that launches the program.

Congratulations! You have succesfully installed **Audacity**.
