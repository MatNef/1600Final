# Creating An Audio File

Upon launch of **Audacity**, you will be welcomed with various links; a video describing changes up in the latest version of Audacity, How to Get Help, Forums, etc. Click "OK"
You will need a microphone if you intend to record yourself and either speakers or headset to hear the playback.
You can purchase a headset with a microphone from any major retailer or order one online; you can get one as cheap as $15.

Provided you are set up with your microphone, you are ready to record. Select the button with the red dot on the top left, or hit R on your keyboard. This begins the voice recording.
Once you have finished your voice recording, select the button with the square at the top left. This stops the recording. 
You may listen to your recording by selecting the button with the sideways triangle, or spacebar on your keyboard. This will plays back what you just recorded. 
If you are satisfied with the recording, continue to the next step. If not, click the "Select" button on the Audio Track, or the "Select" button at the top, choose "Tracks", then choose "In All Tracks". Go to "Edit" located at the top left, choose "Delete" and begin the process anew. 

Click "File" located at the top left, choose "Export", then decide the file type. If there is no preference, select "Export as MP3". 
You are prompted to name your newly created audio file. Name your file and choose the destination. 
You may be prompted to edit Metadata tags. You can skip this step or select the value field and begin typing to input information. Once satisfied, click "OK".

Congratulations! You have created your first audio file using **Audacity**.

If you are interested in learning what else you can do in **Audacity**, such as amplifying sound or blending in multiple sound files, I recommend checking out [Kevin Stratvert's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzJ2VyYkmaA) **Audacity** guide on **YouTube**. In my opinion, it is one of the best "How to" videos you can find online for software.
